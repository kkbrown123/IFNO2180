                    <p>"Robotics is the engineering branch that deals with the conception, design, construction, operation, application, and usage of robots. Digging a little deeper, we see that robots are defined as an automatically operated machine that carries out a series of actions independently and does the work usually accomplished by a human.Incidentally, robots do not have to resemble humans, although some do. Look at images of automobile assembly lines for proof. Robots that appear human are typically referred to as “androids.” Although robot designers make their creations appear human so that people feel more at ease around them, its not always the case. Some people find robots, especially ones that resemble people, creepy."</p>
  
                    <p>"Healthcare: Robots in the healthcare industry do everything from assisting in surgery to physical therapy to help people walk to moving through hospitals and delivering essential supplies such as meds or linens. Healthcare robots have even contributed to the ongoing fight against the pandemic, filling and sealing testing swabs and producing respirators.The field of manufacturing was the first to adopt robots, such as the automobile assembly line machines we previously mentioned. Industrial robots handle a various tasks like arc welding, material handling, steel cutting, and food packaging.Robots handle dangerous tasks, and it doesn't get any more difficult than modern warfare. Consequently, the military enjoys a diverse selection of robots equipped to address many of the riskier jobs associated with war. For example, there's the Centaur, an explosive detection/disposal robot that looks for mines and IEDs, the MUTT, which follows soldiers around and totes their gear, and SAFFiR, which fights fires that break out on naval vessels."</p>

                    <h2>How will robotics be beneficial to all of mankind</h2>
                    <p class="info">September 28, 2023 by Kevonteh Brown</p>

  
                    <img src="Robotics-AI-Bot-800x600_rdax_725x544s.jpg" alt="Image of robot" class="post-img right">
  
                    <p>"Robots are used in multiple areas, especially where they can alleviate strenuous tasks or complete missions that are dangerous for a human to undertake. Recent advances in robotics and AI are revolutionising business, society and our personal lives.Apart from being precise and consistent, robots can work in any environment, adding to their flexibility. Robots eliminate dangerous jobs for humans because they are capable of working in hazardous environments. They can handle lifting heavy loads, toxic substances and repetitive tasks. This has helped companies to prevent many accidents, also saving time and money. In the medical field robots are used for intricate surgeries such as prostate cancer surgery. Robots are able to reach and fit where human hands cannot, allowing greater accuracy. Robotic benefits in the medical field can be less invasive procedures and reduce pain for the patient when recovering. "</p>
  
                    <p>"This Kick-Start activity aims to stimulate the development of robotic applications underpinned by space technologies into a wide variety of sectors such as extreme environments, agriculture, infrastructure monitoring, transport, social care and soft robotics. Also, due to the current pandemic outbreak, robotic technology may provide additional creative solutions to tackle this unprecedented situation.

                        Robotics and AI augment and amplify human potential, increase productivity and are moving from simple reasoning towards human-like cognitive abilities.
                        
                        Space assets and satellite technology can offer added value to the robotics sector and increase its capabilities in a number of ways. "</p>
